\section{Background to the study}

\section{Objectives of this study}

\subsection{Purpose of the study}
	This study is applied to music concert recordings done at the Endler Hall at Stellenbosch University. They have a problem of noise from outside interfering with the recording.

 \subsection{Problems to be investigated}
	This project investigates the effectiveness of cancellation algorithms, commonly used in Passive Radar, applied to recorded audio data.
  Microphones will be placed outside the venue to record the noise directly. The noise recording will be used suppress the same noise picked up on the concert recording. This will be done by determining the delays of the noises and then subtracting it from the concert recording. The algorithms are needed to determine the delays.

  \[s=m-Nx\]

  , where $s$ is the suppressed signal, $m$ is the music concert recording (consisting of the delayed noise), $N$ is a matrix consisting of the noise delayed by increasing amounts with each column of the matrix. $x$ is the unknown. It is the weights for each column of the $N$ matrix.


\section{Scope and Limitations}
	
	This project does not consider Doppler effects.
