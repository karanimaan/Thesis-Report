\[s=m-Nx\]
    
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \xi(x) &=  \sum_{i=1}^{n}{s_i^2} \\
&= x^T N^T N x - 2 m^T Nx + m^T m \\
&= x^T R x - 2 p^T x + \mu
\end{split}
\end{equation}


\[\xi'(x) = 2Rx - 2p\]
In order to find the minimum signal energy, its derivative should be set to 0. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
     \xi'(x) &= 0 \\
    2Rx-2p &= 0 \\
    Rx-p &= 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Batching delays was considered. This did not work. Might be due to not perfect orthogonal. But it was not feasible for multiple delays anyway since if \(\vec{x1}\) and \(\vec{x2}\) had a delay, find \(\vec{x1}\) and setting \(\vec{x2}\) to zero would not work (since \(\vec{x2}\) was not zero).
